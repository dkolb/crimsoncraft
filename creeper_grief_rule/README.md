# Creeper Grief Rule

A pretty blatant rip off of [Convienent `mobGriefing`](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/convenient-mobgriefing)

This is basically that plugin. However, it provides only a `mobGriefingCreeper` rule. Mostly created because the datapack equivalent causes creepers to not damage players.

A rule just for creepers didn't really seem to fit in well with [A5b84](https://github.com/A5b84)'s general design of broad categories.  So I forked it and then ripped out all the extra stuff I didn't need to reduce my maintenance burden.

Requires the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net)

The [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) is required for localisation, but the mod should still work without it.
